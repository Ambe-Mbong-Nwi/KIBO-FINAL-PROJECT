#KIBO EXPERIENCES

## Brief Description of the Project
- This project demonstrates via the aid of slideshows what KIBO is all about. That is its relations to Africa, alumni, goals of the kibo community, courses offered, staff, and so on.

## How to Use it
- To perfectly enjoy the slides, tap on each slide to be taken to the next slide and so on.

## How the code works
- A "click" event was added to the pages so that when they are clicked on, the class "hidden" from the CSS file is run so as to hide that page.
- The next page is then gotten by an iteration and its own "hidden" class removed so the page can be displayed.
